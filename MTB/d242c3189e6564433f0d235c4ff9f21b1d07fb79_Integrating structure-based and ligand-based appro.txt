Abstract:
Methods utilized in computer-aided drug design can be classified into two major categories: structure based and ligand based, using information on the structure of the protein or on the biological and physicochemical properties of bound ligands, respectively. In recent years there has been a trend towards integrating these two methods in order to enhance the reliability and efficiency of computer-aided drug-design approaches by combining information from both the ligand and the protein. This trend resulted in a variety of methods that include: pseudoreceptor methods, pharmacophore methods, fingerprint methods and approaches integrating docking with similarity-based methods. In this article, we will describe the concepts behind each method and selected applications.
