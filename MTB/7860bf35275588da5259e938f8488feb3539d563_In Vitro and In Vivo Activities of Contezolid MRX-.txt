Abstract:
ABSTRACT The in vitro activity of contezolid (MRX-I) against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated using a microtiter broth dilution assay. MRX-I was as effective as linezolid (LZD) in vitro. MRX-I and LZD were subsequently studied in BALB/c mice infected intranasally with M. tuberculosis Erdman. MRX-I and LZD at 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the bacterial load in lungs compared to the untreated early and late controls.
