Abstract:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen. Its success depends on its interaction with the host and its ability to regulate the host’s immune system for its own survival. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) proteome consists of unique PE_PGRS family proteins, which present a significant role in bacterial pathogenesis over the past years. Earlier evidence suggests that some PE_PGRS proteins display fibronectin-binding activity. In this manuscript, computational characterization of the PE_PGRS39 protein has indicated something peculiar about this protein. Investigation showed that PE_PGRS39 is an extracellular protein that, instead of acting as fibronectin-binding protein, might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha-5 beta-1 (α5β1) integrin. PE_PGRS39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as DXXG and GGXGXD and PXXP that bind with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), calcium, and host Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively, in conjunction with RGD-integrin binding. These interactions designate the direct role of PE_PGRS39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling. Additionally, the analysis showed that PE_PGRS39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by T or B cells. Further, an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host.
