Abstract:
Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (mIDH1) is a common driving factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the R132 mutation accounting for a high proportion. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ivosidenib, a molecular entity that targets IDH1 with R132 mutations, as a promising therapeutic option for AML with mIDH1 in 2018. It was of concern that the occurrence of disease resistance or recurrence, attributed to the IDH1 R132C/S280F second site mutation, was observed in certain patients treated with Ivosidenib within the same year. Furthermore, it should be noted that most mIDH1 inhibitors demonstrated limited efficacy against mutations at this specific site. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate novel inhibitors targeting mIDH1 for combating resistance caused by IDH1 R132C/S280F mutations in AML. This study aimed to identify novel mIDH1 R132C/S280F inhibitors through an integrated strategy of combining virtual screening and dynamics simulations. First, 2000 hits were obtained through structure-based virtual screening of the COCONUT database, and hits with better scores than âˆ’10.67 kcal/mol were obtained through molecular docking. A total of 12 potential small molecule inhibitors were identified through pharmacophore modeling screening and Prime MM-GBSA. Dynamics simulations were used to study the binding modes between the positive drug and the first three hits and IDH1 carrying the R132C/S280F mutation. RMSD showed that the four dynamics simulation systems remained stable, and RMSF and Rg showed that the screened molecules have similar local flexibility and tightness to the positive drug. Finally, the lowest energy conformation, hydrogen bond analysis, and free energy decomposition results indicate that in the entire system the key residues LEU120, TRP124, TRP267, and VAL281 mainly contribute van der Waals forces to the interaction, while the key residues VAL276 and CYS379 mainly contribute electrostatic forces.
