Abstract:
The Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC) series, founded in 2003, is an annual international forum for exploring research, development and applications of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The Seventh Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC2009) was held at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China during January 13–16 in 2009. It brought together more than 300 researchers, professionals, industrial practitioners and students from all over the world for interaction and exchange of knowledge and ideas in broad areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. The participants came from 21 nations and regions including (in alphabetical order) Australia, Belgium, Canada, China (the Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Vietnam. This represents the largest submission and participation in the history of APBC. The conference program includes 2 keynotes (Drs. David J. Lipman and Michael S. Waterman), 5 invited talks (Drs. Michael B. Eisen, Bailin Hao, John Mattick, Pavel Pevzner and Martin Vingron), 76 selected talks, 4 tutorial sessions and 120 posters. 
 
The titles of the keynote and invited talks are: 
 
• David J. Lipman: Molecular evolution and epidemiology of seasonal influenza 
 
• Michael S. Waterman: Sequence analysis using Eulerian graphs 
 
• Michael B. Eisen: Understanding and exploiting the evolution of Drosophila regulatory sequences 
 
• Bailin Hao: Independent verification of 16S rRNA based prokaryotic phylogeny by composition vector approach 
 
• John Mattick: A new understanding of the human genome 
 
• Pavel Pevzner: Genome Rearrangements: from Biological Problems to Combinatorial Algorithms 
 
• Martin Vingron: Transcriptional regulation: computational methods, statistics, and coregulation 
 
The topics of the four tutorials are: A structured approach for the dynamics modeling of biomolecular networks (David R. Gilbert, Robin Donaldson, Monika Heiner & Rainer Breitling), Natural language processing for biology: BioNLP (Zhiyong Lu & Kevin Cohen), Bayesian methods in genetic association studies (Matthew Stephens), and Systems biology based on integrated analysis of functional genomics data (Olga G. Troyanskaya). 
 
The APBC series had a tradition of emphasis on rigorous algorithm topics in bioinformatics and computation. In this year's conference, this hallmark was retained while the biological contexts of the topics were given more emphasis. Authors from more diverse backgrounds of computer science, biology, statistics, electrical engineering, medical sciences, chemistry and physics contributed to the conference. The selected papers and posters cover a wide range of themes in current bioinformatics and computational biology. The biological questions studied can be categorized into the following major fields: 
 
• DNA sequence analysis, alignment, evolution and comparative genomics, sequence assembly especially in the context of second-generation deep sequencing technology. 
 
• Gene regulation and expression analysis, including microarray data analysis and integration, transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, and epigenomic factors. 
 
• RNA structure and function, especially non-coding RNAs including microRNAs and RNAi. 
 
• Proteins and proteomics, including protein structure, subcellular location and function and mass spectrometry data processing. 
 
• Biological pathways, networks and systems biology. 
 
• Disease and medical application study, genome-wide association studies. 
 
A total of 204 submissions were received and reviewed by a strong 63-member international Program Committee so that each submission is reviewed at least by 2 PC members, and more than 30 additional reviewers were invited by the PC members to provide extra reviews. The selected talks (all but one are collected in this supplement to BMC Bioinformatics) represent a 37% acceptance rate, and the authors have carefully revised the papers according to the reviews before the publication. A full proceedings of APBC2009, including all the accepted full papers and abstracts, is published by Tsinghua University Press.
