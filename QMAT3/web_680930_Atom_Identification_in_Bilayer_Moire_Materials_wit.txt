Abstract:
**Topic:** Atom identification in bilayer moiré materials using deep learning (Gomb-Net)

**Key Points:**
- Developed Gomb-Net, a deep learning model, to accurately identify atomic positions and species in individual layers of twisted bilayer heterostructures, overcoming challenges posed by moiré patterns.
- Gomb-Net enables layer-specific mapping of atomic positions and dopant distributions, outperforming traditional segmentation models in complex moiré environments.
- Application to twisted fractional Janus WS₂-WS₂(1–x)Se₂ₓ heterostructures revealed that Se atom substitutional site distributions are not influenced by local moiré-induced energetic or electronic modulations.

**Methods:** Deep learning model (Gomb-Net) applied to scanning transmission electron microscopy images for atom identification and mapping.

**Summary:**  
This study introduces Gomb-Net, a deep learning framework designed to identify atomic positions and species in each layer of twisted bilayer van der Waals materials, overcoming the analytical challenges posed by moiré patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy. The model enables precise, layer-specific mapping of atoms and dopants, as demonstrated in Janus WS₂-WS₂(1–x)Se₂ₓ heterostructures, where it was found that Se atom site distributions are unaffected by moiré-induced variations. This advancement opens new possibilities for atomic-scale analysis in complex layered materials.
