Abstract:
**Topic:**  
High-pressure synthesis and structural study of tantalum hydride and a tantalum A15-type polymorph

**Key Points:**  
- A unique tantalum hydride with an A15-type crystal structure was synthesized under high hydrogen pressure (9 GPa) and characterized in a metastable state.
- Hydrogen atoms in the hydride occupy specific Wyckoff sites, and their distribution changes upon annealing; hydrogen desorption occurs in two distinct steps.
- No superconductivity was observed in either the hydride or the hydrogen-free A15-type tantalum polymorph down to 1.5 K.

**Methods:**  
High-pressure synthesis using toroid-type chambers, hot extraction, powder x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering.

**Summary:**  
This study reports the high-pressure synthesis of a novel tantalum hydride with an A15-type crystal structure, achieved by exposing tantalum dihydride to 9 GPa hydrogen pressure. Structural analysis using x-ray and neutron diffraction revealed the occupancy of hydrogen atoms at specific Wyckoff sites, with changes upon annealing and a two-step hydrogen desorption process. Inelastic neutron scattering identified four vibrational modes, and no superconductivity was detected in either the hydride or the hydrogen-free A15-type tantalum polymorph at temperatures as low as 1.5 K.
