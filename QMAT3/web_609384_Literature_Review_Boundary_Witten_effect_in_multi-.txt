Abstract:
**Topic:** Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators

**Key Points:**
- The paper introduces and analyzes the "boundary Witten effect" in three-dimensional multi-axion insulators, where multiple spacetime-dependent mass terms (axion fields) lead to novel topological responses.
- Using dimensional reduction from a (6+1)-dimensional topological field theory, the authors derive a new multi-axion-electromagnetic coupling in (3+1) dimensions, resulting in topological currents and defects such as magnetic monopoles and hopfions.
- At the boundary, the theory predicts that point-like vortices on the gapped surface can acquire half-integer electric charges, a direct manifestation of the boundary Witten effect.

**Methods:** Dimensional reduction from higher-dimensional (6+1) topological field theory to (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions; effective field theory analysis; derivation of topological terms and currents.

**Summary:**  
This paper investigates the topological properties of multi-axion insulators, focusing on the emergence of the boundary Witten effect. By employing dimensional reduction from a (6+1)-dimensional massive Dirac theory, the authors derive new axion-electromagnetic coupling terms in (3+1) dimensions, leading to the prediction of topological currents and defects. Crucially, the analysis reveals that on the gapped boundary of such insulators, point-like vortices can acquire half-integer electric charges, providing a boundary analog of the Witten effect and enriching the understanding of topological phases in condensed matter systems.
