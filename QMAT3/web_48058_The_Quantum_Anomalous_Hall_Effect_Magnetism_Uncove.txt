Abstract:
**Topic:** Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE) and its relationship with magnetism in inorganic compounds

**Key Points:**
- QAHE is a quantum phenomenon where quantized Hall conductance occurs without an external magnetic field, enabled by intrinsic magnetism and topological properties of certain materials.
- Inorganic compounds, such as Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, MnBi2Te4, and V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, are crucial for studying and realizing QAHE, with ongoing research focusing on achieving higher operational temperatures and scalable fabrication.
- Theoretical frameworks involve topological insulators, Berry phase, and Chern insulator models, while experimental methods include molecular beam epitaxy, ARPES, and transport measurements.

**Methods:** Review of theoretical models (topological insulators, Berry phase, Chern number), summary of experimental techniques (MBE, ARPES, transport measurements), and discussion of material-specific experimental findings.

**Summary:**  
This article explores the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE), emphasizing its emergence from the interplay between magnetism and topological properties in inorganic compounds. It reviews the theoretical underpinnings of QAHE, highlights key experimental discoveries in materials such as Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and MnBi2Te4, and discusses the challenges and future directions in achieving QAHE at higher temperatures and in scalable devices. The potential impact of QAHE on low-power electronics and quantum computing is also addressed, positioning it as a promising avenue for future technological innovation.
