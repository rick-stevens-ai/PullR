Abstract:
**Topic:** Materials for Raising the Temperature of Quantized Anomalous Hall and Magnetoelectric Effects

**Key Points:**
- The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and topological magnetoelectric effects are promising for low-power electronics and novel quantum phenomena but are currently only observable at extremely low temperatures due to material limitations.
- Researchers propose a new material platform using magnetic extensions of topological insulator surfaces, specifically combining tetradymite-type nonmagnetic semiconductors (e.g., Bi₂Te₃, Sb₂Te₃) with magnetic insulators like MnBi₂Te₄, to achieve these effects at higher temperatures.
- The approach avoids common issues such as dopant distribution and disorder by using stoichiometric magnetic compounds and is based on first-principles (ab initio) calculations.

**Methods:** First-principles (ab initio) band structure calculations; theoretical modeling of layered material systems.

**Summary:**  
This article discusses recent advances in materials science aimed at increasing the operational temperature of the quantized anomalous Hall and topological magnetoelectric effects, which are crucial for next-generation low-power electronics and quantum technologies. By theoretically designing layered systems that combine nonmagnetic topological insulators with magnetic insulators of similar structure and composition, researchers have proposed a method to break time-reversal symmetry and realize these effects at higher temperatures. The approach, validated by ab initio calculations, offers a promising route to overcoming current material limitations and enabling practical applications of these quantum phenomena.
