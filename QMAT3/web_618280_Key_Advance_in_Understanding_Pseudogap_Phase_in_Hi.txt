Abstract:
**Topic:** Pseudogap Phase in High-Temperature (High-Tc) Copper-Oxide Superconductors

**Key Points:**
- Scientists discovered a fundamental difference in electron behavior at two distinct oxygen-atom sites within each copper-oxide unit in the pseudogap phase, revealing a broken symmetry.
- This asymmetry in electron tunneling may be key to understanding the pseudogap phase, which is believed to inhibit room-temperature superconductivity in copper-oxides.
- The findings could lead to new approaches for overcoming barriers to practical, room-temperature superconducting materials.

**Methods:** Spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy; new theoretical approaches for interpreting electron behavior.

**Summary:**  
Researchers have identified a distinct asymmetry in electron behavior at different oxygen sites within copper-oxide superconductors in the pseudogap phase, using advanced scanning tunneling microscopy and theoretical modeling. This broken symmetry is a hallmark of the pseudogap phase, which is thought to prevent superconductivity at higher temperatures. The discovery provides a significant step toward understanding and potentially overcoming the pseudogap barrier, with the ultimate goal of achieving room-temperature superconductivity for transformative energy applications.
