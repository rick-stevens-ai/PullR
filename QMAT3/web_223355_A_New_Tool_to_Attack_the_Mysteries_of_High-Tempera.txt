Abstract:
**Topic:** High-Temperature Superconductivity and Ultrafast Laser ARPES

**Key Points:**
- Researchers at Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley have used ultrafast laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the electronic states and Cooper-pair formation in high-temperature superconductors.
- The study provides new insights into how quasiparticles recombine into Cooper pairs, revealing that recombination rates depend on both momentum and excitation energy, which may be directly connected to the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials.
- The use of ultrafast laser ARPES enables the observation of femtosecond-scale dynamics in superconductors, offering a new experimental approach to probe the mysteries of high-Tc superconductivity.

**Methods:** Ultrafast laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ultrafast laser ARPES) and all-optical pump-probe techniques.

**Authors:** Led by Alessandra Lanzara, in collaboration with Joseph Orenstein and Dung-Hai Lee; first author Christopher Smallwood.

**Publication Details:** Research published in the June 1, 2012, issue of the journal Science.

**Summary:**  
A team of scientists from Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley has advanced the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity by employing ultrafast laser ARPES to observe the dynamics of Cooper-pair formation in the cuprate superconductor Bi2212. Their experiments reveal that the rate at which quasiparticles recombine into Cooper pairs depends on both their momentum and the energy of the initial excitation, providing new clues about the mechanisms underlying high-Tc superconductivity. This work demonstrates the power of ultrafast laser ARPES to probe electronic processes in superconductors on femtosecond timescales, opening new avenues for investigating the fundamental physics of these complex materials.
