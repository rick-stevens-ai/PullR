Abstract:
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) contribute significantly to global death rates. Likewise, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimated that each year, approximately 3.2 million individuals acquire HAIs, leading to around 37,000 fatalities. This underscores the need for efficient sterilization methods. In response, China has developed sustainable solar thermal autoclave technologies that utilize renewable energy, reducing operational costs and CO₂ emissions. This study conducted a literature review on solar-thermal evaporators technologies developed over the past decade, analyzing patents and prototypes in terms of energy efficiency, achieved temperature, and potential medical applications. Additionally, Peruvian regions with high solar radiation were identified using data from the Global Solar Atlas. The evaluated models include autoclaves with graphene membranes, bioinspired structures, and steam generators with copper tubes. These technologies achieved efficiencies of up to 87.43% and temperatures exceeding 132 °C. Finally, five hospitals in regions with high solar radiation (Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Puno, and Ayacucho) were proposed for the implementation of these solutions, enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system. The incorporation of solar autoclaves in Peru could optimize energy resources and reduce costs, fostering a more sustainable healthcare system. Further research should conduct studies on solar radiation in specific hospitals and adapt Chinese technologies to local needs, promoting investment and the development of innovative medical solutions in the region.
