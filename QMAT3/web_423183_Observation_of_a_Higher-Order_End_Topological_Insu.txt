      The modern theory of quantized polarization has recently extended from 1D dipole moment to multipole moment, leading to the development from conventional topological insulators (TIs) to higher-order TIs, i.e., from the bulk polarization as primary topological index, to the fractional corner charge as secondary topological index. The authors here extend this development by theoretically discovering a higher-order end TI (HOETI) in a real projective lattice and experimentally verifying the prediction using topolectric circuits. A HOETI realizes a dipole-symmetry-protected phase in a higher-dimensional space (conventionally in one dimension), which manifests as 0D topologically protected end states and a fractional end charge. The discovered bulk-end correspondence reveals that the fractional end charge, which is proportional to the bulk topological invariant, can serve as a generic bulk probe of higher-order topology. The authors identify the HOETI experimentally by the presence of localized end states and a fractional end charge. The results demonstrate the existence of fractional charges in non-Euclidean manifolds and open new avenues for understanding the interplay between topological obstructions in real and momentum space.
