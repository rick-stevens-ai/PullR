Abstract:
**Topic:** Direct synthesis of catalyzed alkali metal aluminum hydride compounds

**Key Points:**
- A novel method for directly preparing alkali metal aluminum hydrides (e.g., NaAlH₄, Na₃AlH₆) from alkali metals or their hydrides and aluminum.
- The process includes doping the hydride with a transition metal catalyst (e.g., TiCl₃, TiF₃) to enable reversible hydrogenation.
- The method avoids contamination common in wet chemical synthesis and is simpler and less expensive.

**Methods:** Mechanical mixing of dry reagents under inert atmosphere, followed by high-pressure hydrogen charging and heating to ~125°C.

**Authors:** Not specified

**Summary:**  
This patent discloses a direct, dry synthesis method for producing catalyzed alkali metal aluminum hydrides, such as sodium alanate, using mechanical mixing and high-pressure hydrogenation in the presence of transition metal catalysts. The approach is cost-effective, avoids contamination from wet chemical methods, and yields hydrides suitable for reversible hydrogen storage. The invention was developed with support from the U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration.
