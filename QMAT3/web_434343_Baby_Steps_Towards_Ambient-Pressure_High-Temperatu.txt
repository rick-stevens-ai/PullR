Abstract:
**Topic:** Advances Toward Ambient-Pressure High-Temperature Superconductors

**Key Points:**
- Traditional superconductors require either extremely low temperatures or high pressures, limiting their practical applications.
- Researchers have developed a pressure-quench protocol (PQP) that stabilizes pressure-induced superconducting phases of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (BST) at ambient pressure, potentially paving the way for more practical superconducting materials.
- This method could lead to the discovery and design of new superconductors that operate at higher temperatures and under normal conditions, improving the feasibility of technologies like zero-loss power lines and quantum computers.

**Methods:** 
- Experimental study using high-pressure techniques (up to ~50 GPa) and a pressure-quench protocol to stabilize superconducting phases of BST at ambient pressure.
- Characterization of electric and magnetic properties using a Magnetization Property Measurement System (MPMS).

**Summary:**  
This article discusses recent breakthroughs in the quest for ambient-pressure, high-temperature superconductors. Researchers have successfully stabilized superconducting phases of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 at room pressure using a pressure-quench protocol, overcoming a major barrier to practical applications. While these materials are not yet room-temperature superconductors, the approach opens new avenues for developing superconductors that operate under more accessible conditions, with significant implications for energy, transportation, and quantum computing technologies.
