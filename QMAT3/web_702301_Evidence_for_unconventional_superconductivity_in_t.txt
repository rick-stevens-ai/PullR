Abstract:
**Topic:** Unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)

**Key Points:**
- Experimental evidence indicates that superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is unconventional and not described by the standard Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory.
- Tunneling spectra below the superconducting transition temperature are inconsistent with conventional s-wave superconductors and instead suggest a nodal, anisotropic pairing mechanism.
- The persistence of a tunneling gap even when superconductivity is suppressed, and its absence when MATBG is aligned with hexagonal boron nitride, further supports a non-BCS mechanism.

**Methods:** 
- Combined tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy using a scanning tunneling microscope to probe the superconducting properties of MATBG.

**Summary:**  
This study presents experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), challenging the conventional BCS framework. Using tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy, the authors find evidence for a nodal, anisotropic pairing mechanism and a pseudogap phase, with key features absent when MATBG is aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. These results provide strong evidence for a non-BCS mechanism underlying superconductivity in MATBG.
