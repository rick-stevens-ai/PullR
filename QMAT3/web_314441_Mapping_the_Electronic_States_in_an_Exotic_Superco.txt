Abstract:
**Topic:** Electronic States and Topological Superconductivity in Iron-Based Superconductors

**Key Points:**
- The electronic and magnetic states in iron-tellurium-selenium compounds depend sensitively on local chemical composition, with superconductivity emerging at lower iron concentrations and topological surface states at higher tellurium concentrations.
- The research mapped the phase diagram of these materials, identifying the compositional ranges where topological superconductivity—important for robust quantum computing—can exist.
- The study clarified that the absence of topological superconductivity features in some measurements is due to intrinsic electronic state variations, not experimental error.

**Methods:** 
- Growth of single crystals with varying iron content.
- Spin-polarized neutron scattering to probe magnetic correlations.
- Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy for local chemical composition.
- Microscale electrical resistance measurements.
- Photoemission spectroscopy to map electronic states on the surface and in the bulk.

**Summary:**  
This research, conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory, mapped how electronic and magnetic states in iron-tellurium-selenium superconductors depend on local chemical composition. Using neutron scattering, x-ray spectroscopy, electrical measurements, and photoemission spectroscopy, the team identified the specific compositional ranges where superconductivity and topological surface states—key for error-resistant quantum computing—emerge. Their findings provide a detailed phase diagram, narrowing the search for materials suitable for topological quantum computation and clarifying that intrinsic electronic state variations, not measurement errors, explain the absence of topological features in some samples.
