Abstract:
**Topic:** High-Pressure Hydrogen Materials Synthesis and Testing

**Key Points:**
- High-pressure hydrogen environments are essential for synthesizing and testing advanced hydrogen storage materials, such as metal hydrides and sorbents, for fuel cell applications.
- The HyMARC team operates state-of-the-art facilities capable of subjecting materials to pressures up to 100 MPa and temperatures from -78°C to 400°C, enabling studies of material stability, reversibility, and hydrogen reaction mechanisms.
- Specialized testing includes sorbent stability under high-pressure gases, assessment of metal hydride reversibility, and isotope-exchange studies to investigate hydrogen dissociation and material properties.

**Methods:** Experimental testing using high-pressure hydrogen systems, compatible with Sieverts and PCT equipment, and analytical techniques such as Synchrotron X-ray, neutron diffraction, FTIR, XRD, and NMR.

**Summary:**  
This resource describes the HyMARC team's advanced capabilities for synthesizing and testing hydrogen storage materials under high-pressure hydrogen environments, crucial for fuel cell technology. The facility at Sandia National Laboratories enables comprehensive evaluation of material performance, stability, and reaction mechanisms using a range of experimental and analytical techniques. These capabilities support fundamental research into the physicochemical behavior of hydrogen storage materials, facilitating the development of next-generation hydrogen storage solutions.
