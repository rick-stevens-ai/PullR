Abstract:
**Topic:** Predictive Theory of Correlated Electron Materials

**Key Points:**
- Correlated electron materials exhibit complex properties such as unconventional superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions, which are challenging to predict theoretically due to multiple competing energy scales.
- Advances in Green’s functions and quantum Monte Carlo methods now enable more accurate, first-principles computational predictions of properties in strongly correlated materials.
- Theoretical design and spectroscopy for these materials have historically been difficult, but new computational approaches are opening pathways for predictive modeling.

**Methods:** Advances in Green’s functions and quantum Monte Carlo computational methods; first-principles calculations.

**Summary:**  
This article discusses the theoretical challenges in predicting the properties of strongly correlated electron materials, which display phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions. By leveraging recent advances in Green’s functions and quantum Monte Carlo methods, the authors demonstrate that it is now possible to achieve first-principles computational predictions for these complex materials. This work marks significant progress toward a predictive theory for correlated materials, with implications for both fundamental science and practical applications.
