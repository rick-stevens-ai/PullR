Abstract:
**Topic:** Electronic structure in strongly correlated materials

**Key Points:**
- The report discusses theoretical approaches to understanding the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials, focusing on correlated electron systems.
- It highlights the application of first-principles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to study f-electron correlation effects.
- The presentation includes an introduction, motivation, and a summary of current research and future outlook in the field.

**Methods:** First-principles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) framework

**Authors:** Jianxin Zhu (Los Alamos National Laboratory)

**Summary:**  
This technical report, authored by Jianxin Zhu at Los Alamos National Laboratory, presents an overview of theoretical methods for investigating the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials, with a particular emphasis on the use of first-principles DMFT. The slides outline the motivation for studying correlated electron systems, describe the DMFT framework, and discuss its application to materials with significant f-electron correlation effects. The report concludes with a summary of findings and perspectives on future research directions in the field.
