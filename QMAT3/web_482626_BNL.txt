**Summary:**  
The Chiral Materials and Unconventional Superconductivity Group at Brookhaven National Laboratory conducts fundamental and applied research on quantum materials, particularly focusing on superconductors and topological phases. Their work encompasses experimental synthesis, advanced spectroscopy, and theoretical modeling to understand phenomena such as the chiral magnetic effect, quantum transport, and topological phase transitions. Supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the groupâ€™s research advances both the fundamental understanding and technological applications of quantum materials in energy and quantum information science.
