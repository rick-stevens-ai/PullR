Abstract:
**Topic:** Discovery of the "anomalous anomalous Hall effect" in quantum materials

**Key Points:**
- Researchers accidentally discovered a new magnetic phenomenon, dubbed the "anomalous anomalous Hall effect," in the material KV₃Sb₅ while searching for a quantum spin liquid.
- This effect occurs in a non-magnetic material that produces a powerful Hall effect, suggesting the material's particles "remember" previous magnetic states, leading to unusual electronic behavior.
- The discovery could lead to the development of new sensors and electronic devices due to its unique electronic properties.

**Methods:** Experimental investigation of the material KV₃Sb₅, including material synthesis, measurement, and characterization, followed by collaborative data analysis.

**Authors:** Tyrel M. McQueen (Johns Hopkins University), Jennifer Morey, Brenden Ortiz, Mazhar Ali, and an international team (including members from the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics).

**Summary:**  
While attempting to create a quantum spin liquid, researchers led by Tyrel M. McQueen at Johns Hopkins University discovered a new magnetic phenomenon in the material KV₃Sb₅, which they named the "anomalous anomalous Hall effect." This effect, observed in a non-magnetic material, challenges conventional understanding by showing a strong Hall effect typically associated with magnetism. The finding, published in Science Advances, opens new avenues for material science and potential applications in sensor technology.
