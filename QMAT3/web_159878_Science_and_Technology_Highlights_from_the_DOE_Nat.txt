Abstract:
**Topic:** Science and Technology Highlights from the DOE National Laboratories

**Key Points:**
1. Brookhaven Lab research reveals the origin of the "pseudogap" in high-temperature superconductors, showing it results from electron pairing above the superconducting transition temperature.
2. Jefferson Lab scientists have produced the most precise picture of the pion, providing new insights into the strong force and the role of the quark-gluon sea.
3. Idaho National Laboratory developed an explosives detection system for military bases, while Pacific Northwest National Laboratory advanced techniques for uranium detection in soil and real-time radioactive waste analysis.
4. Ames Laboratory's Robert Angelici is recognized for pioneering research in transition metal chemistry and will receive a major ACS award.
5. NETL is developing MFOAM, next-generation multiphase flow simulation software to improve modeling of fossil fuel reactors.

**Methods:** 
- Experimental physics (superconductivity, particle physics)
- Advanced spectroscopy (cryogenic fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy)
- Engineering and software development (explosives detection, multiphase flow modeling)
- Inorganic chemistry research
