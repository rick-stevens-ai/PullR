Abstract:
**Topic:** Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE) in Inorganic Compounds

**Key Points:**
- QAHE is a quantum phenomenon where a quantized Hall conductance occurs without an external magnetic field, due to the interplay between magnetism and topology in certain materials.
- Key factors influencing QAHE include the presence of magnetism, strong spin-orbit coupling, and specific band structures that yield a non-trivial topological invariant (non-zero Chern number).
- QAHE has significant potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics, but practical realization is currently limited by the need for very low operating temperatures.

**Methods:** 
- Theoretical models such as the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model and Dirac fermion model are used to explain QAHE.
- Experimental techniques include angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and transport measurements.

**Summary:**  
This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE), a phenomenon where quantized Hall conductance arises in certain inorganic compounds without an external magnetic field, due to the interplay of magnetism and topology. It discusses the theoretical background, key experimental observations, and the main challengesâ€”particularly the need to achieve QAHE at higher temperatures for practical applications. The article highlights QAHE's potential to revolutionize quantum computing and spintronics, and outlines future research directions focused on new materials and improved theoretical models.
