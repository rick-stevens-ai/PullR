Abstract:
**Topic:** Demonstration of the Kane-Mele Model and Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semiconductor System

**Key Points:**
- Cornell researchers successfully demonstrated both the quantum anomalous Hall insulator and the two-dimensional topological insulator states in a single semiconductor system (MoTe₂/WSe₂ stack), realizing the long-sought Kane-Mele model.
- This breakthrough enables toggling between these exotic quantum states by adjusting voltage, a feat not previously achieved in a single material platform.
- The discovery opens pathways for advances in quantum devices, including potential applications in quantum computing and high-temperature dissipationless conductors.

**Methods:** Experimental fabrication and measurement of twisted MoTe₂/WSe₂ semiconductor stacks; voltage tuning; theoretical calculations in collaboration with MIT.

**Publication Details:** Paper titled “Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Intertwined Moiré Bands,” published December 22, 2021, in Nature.

**Summary:**  
Cornell researchers have experimentally realized the elusive Kane-Mele model by demonstrating both the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the two-dimensional topological insulator state in a single MoTe₂/WSe₂ semiconductor stack. By twisting and voltage-tuning the stack, they achieved quantum states previously theorized but never observed together in one material, marking a significant advance in condensed matter physics. This work not only validates a foundational theoretical model but also paves the way for new quantum devices and potential improvements in quantum computing technologies.
