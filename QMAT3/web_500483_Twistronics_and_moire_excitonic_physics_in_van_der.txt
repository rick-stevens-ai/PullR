Abstract:
**Topic:**  
Twistronics and moiré excitonic physics in van der Waals heterostructures

**Key Points:**  
- The review summarizes recent advances in twistronics and moiré excitonic physics in two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, focusing on how interlayer twist angles and lattice mismatches affect electronic and excitonic properties.
- It discusses the impact of moiré superlattices on exciton dynamics, including formation, transport, and relaxation, as well as the emergence of new quantum phenomena such as exciton localization and correlated electronic states.
- The article highlights the tunability of these systems via external factors (electric field, doping, strain), positioning moiré lattices as promising platforms for optoelectronic applications and quantum physics research.

**Methods:**  
Systematic topical review of theoretical analyses and experimental observations in the field.
