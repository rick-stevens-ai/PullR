Abstract:
**Topic:** Pseudogap and Superconducting Gap in High-Temperature Superconductors

**Key Points:**
- Two distinct energy gaps (pseudogap and superconducting gap) coexist in underdoped high-Tc cuprate superconductors, each with opposite doping dependence.
- The pseudogap in the antinodal region is likely a competing state rather than a precursor to superconductivity, while the superconducting gap is associated with the Fermi Arc region.
- This two-gap scenario resolves previous contradictions in experimental observations and has significant implications for understanding the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity.

**Methods:** Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on underdoped Bi2Sr2Ca1-xYxCu2O8+Î´ (Bi2212) samples with varying doping levels and transition temperatures.

**Summary:**  
This study investigates the electronic structure of underdoped high-temperature superconductor Bi2212 using ARPES, revealing the coexistence of two distinct energy gaps: a superconducting gap near the Fermi Arc and a pseudogap near the antinodal region. These gaps show opposite trends with doping, suggesting that the pseudogap is not a precursor to superconductivity but rather a competing state. The findings provide a unified explanation for previously conflicting experimental results and offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying high-Tc superconductivity.
