Abstract:
EBER 1, a small noncoding viral RNA abundantly expressed in all cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has been shown to associate with the human ribosomal protein L22. Here we present in vitro binding studies using purified RNAs and recombinant proteins. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) show that recombinant L22 (rL22) and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged L22 protein bind EBER 1 in vitro, both forming three specific protein-dependent mobility shifts. Use of a mixture of rL22 and MBP-L22 indicates that these three shifts contain one, two, or three L22 proteins per EBER 1 molecule. EMSAs performed with EBER 1 deletion constructs and EBER 1 stem-loops inserted into a nonbinding RNA, HSUR 3, identify stem-loops I, III, and IV as L22 binding sites. The existence of multiple L22 binding sites on EBER 1 inside cells is demonstrated by in vivo UV cross-linking. Our results are discussed with respect to the function of EBER 1 in EBV-infected human B cells.
