Abstract:
The theoretical predictions and experimental syntheses of hydrogen sulfide (H3S) have ignited a surge of research interest in hydride superconductors. Over the past two decades, extensive investigations have been conducted on hydrides with the ultimate goal of achieving room-temperature superconductivity under ambient conditions. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the current strategies and progress towards this goal in hydride materials. We conclude their electronic characteristics, hydrogen atom aggregation forms, stability mechanisms, and more. While providing a real-time snapshot of the research landscape, our aim is to offer deeper insights into reducing the stabilizing pressure for high-temperature superconductors in hydrides. This involves defining key long-term theoretical and experimental opportunities and challenges. Although achieving high critical temperatures for hydrogen-based superconductors still requires high pressure, we remain confident in the potential of hydrides as candidates for room-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure.
