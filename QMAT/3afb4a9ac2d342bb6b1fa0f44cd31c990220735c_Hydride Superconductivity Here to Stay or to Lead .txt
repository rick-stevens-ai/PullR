Abstract:

 In a recent paper (Boebinger et al. Nat. Rev. Phys. 7, 2 2025; 2024), fifteen prominent leaders in the field of condensed matter physics declare that hydride superconductivity is real, and urge funding agencies to continue to support the field. I question the validity and constructiveness of their argument.
