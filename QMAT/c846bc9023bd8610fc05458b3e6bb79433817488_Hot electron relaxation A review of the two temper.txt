Abstract:
The famous Two-Temperature Model (TTM) used extensively in the investigations of energy relaxation in photo excited systems originated in the seminal work of Kaganov et al. [Sov. J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 4, 173 (1957)]. The idea that with an ultrashort laser pulse a temporal (transient) state of electrons in a metal can be created, in which electrons after absorbing energy from the laser pulse heat up and their temperature becomes substantially greater than that of lattice, was originated in the work of Anisimov et al. [Sov. J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 39, 375 (1974)]. The heated electron sub-system (hot electrons) loses its energy to phonon sub-system via electron–phonon scattering, and thermodynamic equilibrium re-establishes over a time scale of a few picoseconds in metals. This field saw great developments in the 1980s and 1990s with the advent of femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy. From 2000 onward, focus shifted from non-equilibrium phenomena in simple metals to those in more complex systems including strongly correlated systems such as high Tc cuprate superconductors. P. B. Allen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 1460 (1987), revisits the calculations of KLT and rewrites the electron–phonon heat transfer coefficient α in terms of a very important parameter in the theory of superconductivity (λ⟨ω2⟩). This has far reaching consequences; λ, a very crucial dimensionless electron–phonon coupling parameter for a given superconducting material, can be estimated by doing pump–probe experiments on it. By mid 1990s, it became clear that TTM is violated and is not a sufficient model to discuss non-equilibrium relaxation. Year 2000 onward, field saw the development of models that go beyond the original TTM. Very recently, the field has entered into the attosecond domain. In this article, the author attempts a concise account of the development of the TTM and, in addition, a recent possible revival of it in the attosecond domain.
