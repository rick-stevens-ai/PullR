Abstract:
<sc>rebco</sc> coated conductors have a strong potential for high-field magnet applications. The <sc>rebco</sc> technology, however, is still in its infancy for accelerator magnet applications. As part of the U.S. Magnet Development Program, we developed a six-layer canted <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\cos \theta$</tex-math></inline-formula> dipole magnet, C3a, using <sc>corc</sc> wires developed by Advanced Conductor Technologies LLC. All the layers were wound using a semiautomated winding machine. Three layers of the magnet used <sc>corc</sc> wires containing the SuperPower “AP” <sc>rebco</sc> tapes and the remaining layers used the wires containing the “HM” tapes. At 77 K, both kinds of <sc>corc</sc> wires showed 5% to 10% degradation, after bending to a minimum bend radius of 30 or 35 mm, with respect to the self-field critical current measured before winding. At 4.2 K, the magnet reached 9.5 kA at a ramp rate of 9 A s<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and generated a dipole field of 1.4 T. The critical current of one layer degraded by 4% after a current transient up to 10.5 kA ramped in an averaged rate of 175 kA s<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula> or 20 T s<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>. We confirmed the HM <sc>corc</sc> wire can carry a higher current than the AP <sc>corc</sc> wire at 4.2 K. The test results of the C3a magnet showed that the fabrication and assembly procedure can be used for the upcoming full-scale C3 magnet.
