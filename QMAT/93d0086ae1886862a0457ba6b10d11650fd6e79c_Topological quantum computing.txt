Abstract:
These lecture notes offer a pedagogical yet concise introduction to topological quantum computing. The material focuses on topological superconductors and Majorana qubits. It concludes with a discussion of more general braiding phenomena. In particular, the notes delve into the non-Abelian braiding statistics of Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Although not comprehensive, this set provides a solid entry point for students and researchers interested in the field.
