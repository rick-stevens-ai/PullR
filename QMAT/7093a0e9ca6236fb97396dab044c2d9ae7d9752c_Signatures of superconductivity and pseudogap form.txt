Abstract:
We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission to measure the nodal non-equilibrium electronic states in various dopings of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. We find that the initial pump-induced transient signal of these ungapped states is strongly affected by the onset of the superconducting gap at $T_c$, superconducting pairing fluctuations at $T_p$, and the pseudogap at $T^*$. Moreover, $T_p$ marks a suggestive threshold in the fluence-dependent transient signal, with the appearance of a critical fluence below $T_p$ that corresponds to the energy required to break apart all Cooper pairs. These results challenge the notion of a nodal-antinodal dichotomy in cuprate superconductors by establishing a new link between nodal quasiparticles and the cuprate phase diagram.
