Abstract:
Over the last two decades, the competing orders in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates have been intensely studied, such as pseudogap phase, charge density waves (CDW), and pair density waves (PDW), which are thought to play a crucial role in high-temperature superconductivity. Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's"cheap vortex"scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.
