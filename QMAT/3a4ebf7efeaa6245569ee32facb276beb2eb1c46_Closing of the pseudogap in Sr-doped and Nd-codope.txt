Abstract:
Doping of La2CuO4 and La1.6Nd0.4CuO4 with Sr gives rise to holes that locate pairwise at lattice-site O atoms. Such O atoms reside as lattice defects only in the CuO2 planes if the doping level x is below a watershed value, x < x̂, but also in each bracketing LaO layer if x > x̂. The O atoms form a 2D charge order of incommensurability q2 CO (x) and q LaO CO (x), respectively. At the doping x∗ (quantum critical point) that causes the closing of the pseudogap at T = 0, q2 CO (x ∗) = 2qLaO CO (x ∗) holds. 1 ar X iv :2 10 9. 03 04 6v 1 [ ph ys ic s. ge nph ] 2 6 A ug 2 02 1 I. CHARGE ORDER IN La2−xSrxCuO4 When La2CuO4 is doped with strontium, substitution of La → La + 3e− by Sr → Sr +2e− causes a lack of electrons, or equivalently, a creation of holes. Coulomb repulsion spreads the holes, which then attach pairwise to oxygen, O2− + 2e → O. The O atoms form a charge order (CO) by a 2D superlattice in each CuO2 plane of La2−xSrxCuO4. The reciprocal of the superlattice spacing, A0(x) = B0(x), is called the incommensurability, 1 1 A0(x) ≡ q2 CO (x) = Ω± 2 √ x− p̃ , x < x̂ . (1) In the medium doping range, 0.10 4 x 4 0.15, the charge order manifests as unidirectional stripes, at higher doping as nematicity. The formula, in reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.), is valid for doping up to a “watershed” concentration x̂, which depends on the species of doping. The stripe-orientation factor is Ω = √ 2 for x > x6 = 2/6 2 ' 0.056 when stripes are parallel to the a or b axis, but Ω− = 1 for x < x6 when stripes are diagonal. The offset value p̃ under the radical is the hole concentration necessary to keep three-dimensional antiferromagnetism (3D-AFM) suppressed. Their skirmisher task keeps those “suppressor holes” from participating in charge order. Also because of Coulomb repulsion, the doped-hole concentration saturates in the CuO2 planes at x̂, causing the square-root curve from Eq.(1) to level off, with increased doping, to a constant plateau (depending on dopant and co-dopant species), q2 CO (x) = √ 2 2 √ x̂− p̃ , x ≥ x̂ , (2) (see Fig. 1). Additional doped holes then overflow to the LaO layers that sandwich the CuO2 planes, where they also reside pairwise in (apical) O atoms. Again, Coulomb repulsion spreads the double holes to a planar superlattice of lattice-defect O atoms in each LaO layer, with attending charge order of incommensurability q CO (x) = √ 2 2 √ x− x̂ 2 , x ≥ x̂ . (3) The denominator 2 under the radical is due to the two LaO layers per unit cell. The Sr doping that causes the closing of the pseudogap at T = 0 is denoted as x∗. It is widely regarded a quantum critical point. Inserting the observed data of x̂, p̃, and x∗ of La2−xSrxCuO4 from Table I into Eqs. (2, 3) gives incommensurabilities 2q CO (x ∗) = q2 CO (x̂) = q CuO2 CO (x ∗) . (4)
