Abstract:
High-temperature superconductivity remains a major frontier in condensed matter physics, offering potential breakthroughs in energy transmission, quantum computing, and advanced electronic applications. This review explores the chemical and physical principles underlying high-temperature superconductors (HTS), emphasizing their synthesis, structural characteristics, and electronic properties. The discovery of cup rate and iron-based superconductors has challenged conventional BCS theory, introducing novel mechanisms such as strong electron correlations and unconventional pairing symmetries. Advances in doping strategies, pressure-induced superconductivity, and interface engineering have significantly enhanced critical temperatures and performance. Recent experimental techniques, including angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), provide deeper insights into HTS phase diagrams and their quantum states. Additionally, the role of chemical substitutions, lattice distortions, and electron-phonon interactions in modulating superconductivity is discussed. Challenges such as material instability, synthesis complexities, and the search for room-temperature superconductors remain key research directions. Emerging materials, including hydrogen-based and nickelate superconductors, suggest promising pathways for next-generation applications. By integrating theoretical models with experimental discoveries, this review highlights the fundamental and applied advancements in high-temperature superconductivity, paving the way for novel materials with enhanced superconducting properties. The interplay of chemistry and physics continues to drive innovations in this field, shaping the future of superconducting technologies.
