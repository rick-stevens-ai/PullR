Abstract:
An interacting lattice model describing the subspace spanned by a set of strongly-correlated bands is rigorously coupled to density functional theory to enable ab initio calculations of geometric and topological material properties. The strongly-correlated subspace is identified from the occupation number band structure as opposed to a mean-field energy band structure. The self-consistent solution of the many-body model Hamiltonian and a generalized Kohn-Sham equation exactly incorporates momentum-dependent and crystal-symmetric correlations into electronic structure calculations in a way that does not rely on a separation of energy scales. Calculations for a multiorbital Hubbard model demonstrate that the theory accurately reproduces the many-body polarization.
